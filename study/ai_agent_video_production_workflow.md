# AI Agent Video Production Workflow

> Companion to `human_video_production_workflow.md`. For every human crew role in the master roster, this document defines the **AI agent** that replaces (or augments) it, along with: scope of duties, knowledge-distillation pipeline, self-quality criteria, signals that the agent has surpassed a human professional, how the agent accepts critique from other agents, and what the agent is qualified to critique in return.

---

## 1. System Foundations and Reference-Scanning Plan

| Pattern | Purpose | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-Refine** | Agent drafts → self-critiques against rubric → revises | Madaan et al., 2023 |
| **Reflexion** | Agent stores verbal feedback in episodic memory, retries | Shinn et al., 2023 |
| **RLAIF / Constitutional AI** | Reward signal from AI critic governed by a written constitution | Bai et al., 2022 |
| **Multi-agent debate** | Two+ agents argue; judge agent picks the better answer | Du et al., 2023 (LLM debate) |
| **LLM-as-Judge with rubric** | Frozen judge model scores outputs against pre-registered rubric | Zheng et al., 2023 (MT-Bench) |
| **Pairwise preference (Arena)** | Blind A/B vote between agent output and human reference | LMSYS Chatbot Arena methodology |
| **Tool-use / ReAct** | Agent reasons + calls external tools (renderers, validators) | Yao et al., 2022 |
| **Agentic graph (CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph)** | Roles orchestrated as a DAG with handoffs and review gates | CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph |
| **Provenance (C2PA)** | Every artifact signed; downstream agents verify the chain | C2PA spec |

All agents below are assumed to be implemented as orchestrated nodes in a CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph topology, with tool access to generative video models (Sora, Veo, Runway, Kling), TTS/voice-clone APIs (ElevenLabs, Sync.so, Hedra), DCC tooling (Resolve, Nuke, AE via MCP bridges), and a shared critique bus.

### 1.1 Reference Scanning and Knowledge-Synthesis Workflow

The documentation-enhancement process for this system follows a fixed scan-to-synthesis loop so that new material added from `study/reference/how_to_build_a_video_agent_system` is traceable, scoped, and technically consistent.

| Step | Method | What is extracted | Admission rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** | Enumerate all chapters, agent lists, and distillation notes before reading | File coverage map, chapter clusters, missing topic alerts | No section is updated until all reference files are indexed |
| **Cluster** | Group files by function: orchestration, creation, QA, delivery, optimization, training | Thematic buckets and overlap map | A concept must be assigned to at least one workflow stage |
| **Extract** | Pull technical concepts, implementation details, metrics, handoffs, and best practices | Candidate facts, agent responsibilities, thresholds, artifact types | Extract only claims that are specific enough to operationalize |
| **Verify** | Cross-check each candidate against a second reference chapter, an existing section, or a standards anchor already named in this file | Verified additions, rejected assumptions, ambiguity flags | Ambiguous or single-source claims remain out of the core workflow |
| **Map** | Attach verified material to the most relevant section in this document | Patch list by section, table, or phase gate | Prefer enriching existing structure over adding parallel taxonomies |
| **Integrate** | Rewrite affected sections so new detail strengthens architecture, handoffs, and evaluation logic | Updated workflow prose, tables, and shared contracts | Added material must improve technical depth without duplicating nearby content |
| **Review** | Re-read end to end for consistency, completeness, terminology, and factual alignment | Finalized revision set and follow-up fixes | No release until naming, logic flow, and gate criteria are internally consistent |

**Working rules:**
1. Extract concepts under four lenses: **technical architecture**, **implementation sequence**, **quality/compliance**, and **continuous learning**.
2. Prefer workflow-relevant facts over market commentary unless the market fact changes routing, cost, or scale decisions.
3. Record handoff artifacts explicitly: prompts, scene packets, stems, graded masters, manifests, provenance bundles, and telemetry.
4. Reject role inflation unless a new role closes a real gap in orchestration, validation, continuity, delivery, or retraining.
5. Treat delivery packaging, observability, and asset management as system architecture, not postscript operations.

### 1.2 Runtime Production Systems Architecture

| Layer | Core responsibility | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration runtime** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, and escalate agent tasks | PlannerAgent decomposes the brief; OrchestratorAgent executes the DAG; RouterAgent selects agent-model pairs; JudgeAgent arbitrates disputes |
| **Asset and data backbone** | Store every prompt, source asset, derived asset, version, dependency edge, and usage right | Requires immutable asset IDs, copy-on-write versions, dependency-triggered rerender rules, and searchable metadata |
| **Message and state fabric** | Carry critique, job status, render events, and gate decisions across agents | Event-driven bus plus durable state store; every long-running job must be resumable and auditable |
| **Quality and continuity mesh** | Run technical QC, continuity checks, artifact detection, accessibility, and compliance gates | Uses multi-pass validation, temporal continuity scans, loudness and color checks, and role-specific rubric judges |
| **Observability and replay** | Expose live status, failure causes, bottlenecks, and historical decisions | Structured logs, job timelines, gate dashboards, benchmark alerts, and replayable artifact lineage |
| **Delivery fabric** | Package masters into theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, trailer, and campaign variants | Distribution is a branching pipeline with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, and provenance payloads |
| **Compute and storage scaling** | Match infrastructure spend to production scale without breaking deadlines | Separate interactive generation from batch rendering; autoscale GPU pools; tier hot, warm, and archive storage |

### 1.3 Shared Artifact Handoff Contract

Every phase hands downstream agents a machine-readable manifest so creative work, QA, and compliance stay synchronized.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **artifact_id / version** | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| **parent_assets** | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems, references, and prior cuts |
| **brief_scope** | The exact subtask, acceptance criteria, and target audience segment |
| **technical_spec** | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness, caption requirements |
| **rights_and_consent** | License state, likeness/voice consent state, territorial limits, embargo rules |
| **continuity_state** | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, scene-time logic, and identity hash |
| **qc_status** | Latest L1/L2/L3 result plus six-pass delivery-QC status |
| **target_channels** | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, paid social, CRM, LMS, or festival endpoints |
| **provenance_manifest** | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, and final sign-off chain |

### 1.4 Reassessment Discipline

Documentation changes for this system are reviewed as a repeated challenge cycle rather than a single proofread. A 100-pass reassessment can be grouped into the following bands:

| Passes | Primary question |
|---|---|
| **1-20** | Are all extracted claims traceable to the reference set and aligned with the document's structure? |
| **21-40** | Does the architecture describe the real control plane: orchestration, memory, assets, delivery, and observability? |
| **41-60** | Are workflow handoffs explicit enough for implementation, QA, continuity, and compliance automation? |
| **61-80** | Are metrics, thresholds, and evaluation layers technically coherent across creative, technical, and business gates? |
| **81-100** | Is the wording unambiguous, internally consistent, and suitable for professional technical documentation? |

> **Composition rule**: Craft agents (§2.1–2.8) do the work. Meta-agents (§2.9) shape *how* the work is done — orchestration agents run the graph, creative agents widen the search space, research agents ground every claim, optimization agents tighten cost / latency / quality / safety on every iteration.

## 3. Agent Crew per Workflow Archetype

Maps the 10 workflows in `human_video_production_workflow.md` to agent-only crews per phase. Each cell lists the **lead agent** for that phase plus any critic agents that gate the handoff.

### 3.0 Shared Workflow Skeleton and Handoff Contracts

Before any archetype-specific crew activates, every workflow passes through the same operational skeleton. For compactness, the tables in §3.1-§3.10 fold **greenlight** into Concept and fold **channel packaging** into Distribution, but the underlying handoff contract remains the same.

| Phase | Primary outputs | Mandatory gates |
|---|---|---|
| **Greenlight** | Approved brief, KPI targets, budget envelope, rights-risk register, scale profile | ProducerAgent, FinanceAgent, ComplianceAgent, PlannerAgent |
| **Pre-production packet** | Script lock, storyboard/lookbook, asset IDs, character/world bibles, consent state, continuity baselines | DirectorAgent, ScreenwriterAgent, Asset/Data Backbone, Continuity checks |
| **Production packet** | Shot prompts, camera plans, performance refs, plates, generated takes, render telemetry | PromptEngineerAgent / GeneratorOperator, CinematographerAgent, AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| **Post master** | Timelines, graded masters, stems, captions/subtitles, QC reports, outlet variants | EditorAgent, ColoristAgent, SoundMixerAgent, Accessibility checks |
| **Review and release pack** | AudienceSim results, legal review, provenance bundle, sign-off log, unresolved-risk list | ComplianceAgent, JudgeAgent, HumanInTheLoop when required |
| **Distribution package** | DCP, streaming mezzanine, broadcast master, archive package, trailer/social cutdowns, metadata bundle | Delivery-spec validation, accessibility validation, territorial rights validation |
| **Post-launch learning set** | Performance telemetry, corrections, defect log, benchmark deltas, retraining tickets | AnalystAgent, EvaluationHarnessAgent, PromptOptimizerAgent, model-improvement loop |

**Distribution branching rule:** any workflow at S2 scale or above should assume at least four downstream branches when relevant: **theatrical**, **streaming**, **broadcast**, and **archive**, with marketing derivatives generated in parallel rather than as an afterthought.

## 5. Universal Success-Criteria Framework

Every agent reports its self-quality on three layers; orchestrator advances the DAG only when all three pass.

| Layer | Question | Mechanism | Pass Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema check + tool-validators (codec, LUFS, aspect, length) | 100% |
| **L2 Rubric** | Does it meet the craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-judge with role-specific constitution (e.g., Murch's Rule of Six for editing) | ≥85/100 |
| **L3 Preference** | Would the target audience choose this over a human baseline? | Pairwise vs human reference, AudienceSim panel of ≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples | Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass) |

### Delivery QC Mesh

The L1/L2/L3 framework governs agent quality, but no asset is releasable until it also clears the shared six-pass delivery mesh:

| Pass | Focus | Typical checks |
|---|---|---|
| **Q1 Spec validation** | File and schema correctness | Resolution, duration, frame rate, aspect ratio, codec, metadata completeness |
| **Q2 Visual artifact detection** | Render integrity | Banding, flicker, compression artifacts, focus failure, temporal instability |
| **Q3 Audio and sync validation** | Sound quality | Loudness target, clipping, phase coherence, phoneme-viseme sync, lip-sync drift |
| **Q4 Continuity validation** | Story and scene consistency | Character identity, wardrobe, props, environment state, temporal logic |
| **Q5 Perceptual quality** | Human-viewer plausibility | Aesthetic preference, intelligibility, emotional fit, perceived polish |
| **Q6 Delivery compliance** | Outlet readiness | DCP/package validation, streaming metadata, broadcast safe levels, archive checksums, caption availability |

### How an Agent Knows It Surpasses Human Pros

| Surpass Signal | Measurement |
|---|---|
| **Benchmark dominance** | Beats human top-quartile on the domain-standard benchmark (VBench, USMLE, CFA L3, MQM, ATD L2, etc.) |
| **Blind preference** | LMSYS-Arena-style ≥55% win rate vs credentialed pro on matched briefs |
| **Speed × quality** | Equal L2 rubric score at ≤10% of human turnaround time |
| **Error rate** | Lower post-publish defect rate (corrections, takedowns, returns) over 90-day window |
| **Certification** | Passes the same accrediting exam the human pro must pass (CMI, CFA, CAS, USMLE, etc.) |
| **Originality** | Higher novelty score (embedding distance from training corpus) without lower quality |

---

## 6. Critique Protocol (how agents accept and give critique)

All inter-agent critique flows over a shared **CritiqueMessage** JSON schema. This is the universal mechanism by which any agent can comment on any other agent's work and any agent can ingest critique to revise.

```json
{
  "critique_id": "uuid",
  "from_agent": "EditorAgent",
  "to_agent": "DirectorAgent",
  "artifact_ref": "shot_42_take_3.mp4",
  "severity": "blocker | major | minor | nit",
  "category": "pacing | continuity | accuracy | compliance | accessibility | brand | craft",
  "evidence": ["timecode 00:01:14 — held 1.4s past the cut point per genre prior"],
  "suggested_action": "trim 1.0s; re-evaluate hold",
  "rubric_reference": "Murch Rule of Six §3",
  "must_resolve_before": "phase_4_review"
}
```

**Acceptance rules:**
1. **Blocker** severity halts the DAG until resolved.
2. **Major** triggers a Self-Refine / Reflexion loop (max 3 iterations) on the receiving agent.
3. **Minor / nit** is logged to the agent's memory store and aggregated for the next training cycle (RLAIF reward signal).
4. Disputes between two agents go to a **JudgeAgent** running multi-agent debate (Du et al. 2023) with the relevant rubric as the constitution; if unresolved, escalates to a HumanInTheLoop reviewer.
5. Every accepted critique is appended to the artifact's C2PA provenance chain so downstream agents and humans can audit.

---

## 7. Continuous Distillation Loop

How agents keep learning from real practitioners:

| Stage | Mechanism | Real-World Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| **Bootstrap** | Pre-train on publicly available + licensed pro corpora | IMDb top-rated full-credits films, Criterion commentaries, ASC/ACE/CAS archives, Cannes/Sundance selections |
| **Expert interviews** | Consented capture of working pros (paid) → instruction-tune | Direct partnerships with named DGA/WGA/ASC/ACE/CAS/MPSE/VES members |
| **Live RLAIF** | Working pros (and JudgeAgents) score outputs → DPO/KTO updates | Studio QC sessions, festival juror rubrics |
| **Award-rubric grounding** | Reverse-engineer scoring sheets of major guilds → constitution | DGA, WGA, ASC, ACE, MPSE, VES, Annie, CAS, HPA, Cannes, AMPAS |
| **Adversarial red-team** | DeepfakeDetectionAgent + EthicsAgent attack each new model version | Hany Farid lab benchmarks; Partnership on AI Synthetic Media Framework |
| **Post-launch reality check** | 30/60/90-day metrics fed back as ground truth (retention, ROAS, completion, awards) | YouTube Analytics, Wistia, Meta/TikTok ad reports, Metacritic, Box Office Mojo |

### 7.1 Distillation Inputs and Governance

| Data family | Examples | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Narrative text** | Scripts, subtitles, transcripts, treatments, reviews | Trains story structure, dialogue, narrative compression, and claim extraction |
| **Visual material** | Storyboards, frames, plates, concept art, shot libraries | Grounds composition, continuity, lensing, and style transfer |
| **Audio material** | Dialogue, ADR, ambience, SFX libraries, score stems | Supports voice, sync, sound design, mix, and emotion modeling |
| **Structured metadata** | Budgets, schedules, rights records, view-through, CTR, ROAS, corrections | Connects creative output to business and compliance outcomes |
| **Multimodal pairs** | Video + audio + subtitle sets, prompt/output pairs, scene packets | Enables end-to-end generation, QA, and retrieval workflows |
| **Operational telemetry** | Queue depth, render latency, rerender reasons, cache hits, benchmark regressions | Turns production behavior into optimization and retraining signal |

**Governance rules:** licensed or consented sourcing only; explicit voice/likeness consent chain; dataset versioning; bias balancing across genre, era, language, and culture; provenance attachment for all release-critical assets.

### 7.2 Scale Profiles and Deployment Strategy

| Scale | Typical scope | Workflow implications |
|---|---|---|
| **S1-S2** | Short clips, UGC ads, lightweight explainers | Small agent set, fast iterations, limited branching, lighter observability stack |
| **S3-S4** | Broadcast, premium social, music video, recurring branded series | Add continuity, stronger QC, multi-format delivery, scheduled publishing, richer analytics |
| **S5-S6** | Documentary, long-form branded content, enterprise learning libraries | Require archive strategy, stronger rights management, benchmark monitoring, multilingual packaging |
| **S7** | Feature-length or cinematic productions | Full branch packaging, heavy render orchestration, distributed storage, formal release governance, long-tail retraining |

### 7.3 Closed-Loop Improvement

1. Capture post-launch telemetry across audience retention, ROAS, completion, corrections, and platform-specific delivery failures.
2. Convert repeated failure modes into prompt updates, routing policies, rubric revisions, or model-training tickets.
3. Run benchmark and regression suites before promoting a new model, prompt pack, or orchestration policy.
4. Use canary or limited-rollout deployment for high-risk changes in avatar, voice, compliance, and delivery pipelines.

These remain non-negotiably human (per current ethics + regulation, May 2026):

- **Consent for voice/likeness cloning** (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50)
- **Final legal sign-off** on novel IP/defamation/medical/financial claims
- **Casting of real human performers** when used
- **Editorial standards on news/journalism** (per SPJ, IFCN)
- **MPA rating + theatrical clearance**
- **Festival-eligibility certification** (most major fests require human attribution disclosure)
- **Crisis communication** during post-launch issues
- **Cross-cultural sensitivity review** in localization (NativeReviewerAgent recommends; human ratifies)
