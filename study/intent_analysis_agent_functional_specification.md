**Deep Intent Analysis Framework (DIA) v2.0**  
**Comprehensive Functional Specification Document**

**Version:** 2.0 (Research-Enhanced)  
**Date:** May 26, 2026  
**Status:** Complete Functional Specification  
**Basis:** Original 6-phase DIA (from conversation history) + deep integration of 2025–2026 arXiv research on computational pragmatics, speech act theory, LLM-based intent/implicature reasoning, multi-party discourse analysis, and xAI Grok capabilities.

---

### 1. Executive Summary

The **Deep Intent Analysis Framework (DIA) v2.0** is a complete, production-ready, modular system for systematically decoding any text’s **purpose**, **hidden agenda**, **multi-angle perspectives**, **illocutionary force**, and **ethical/behavioral quality**.  

It transforms the original 6-phase manual/LLM-prompt pipeline into a **fully specified, agentic, evaluable software system** built on xAI’s Grok-4.3 (or latest) with native tool use, 1M+ token context, structured outputs, and low-hallucination reasoning.

**Core Objectives**  
- Answer: *Why does this language exist? What is the real goal? What is hidden? How many angles exist? Is the behavior good/wrong/effective?*  
- Achieve human-expert-level pragmatic reasoning at scale.  
- Support manual use, API, web app, IDE plugin, and enterprise analytics.

**Key v2.0 Improvements (from arXiv + xAI research)**  
- **Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC)** integration for superior implicature & hidden-agenda detection.  
- **Multi-Perspective Agent Simulation** (inspired by multi-party conversational agents survey) for richer angle mapping.  
- **Gricean + Extended Maxims** (including Benevolence & Transparency for AI contexts).  
- **Automated Speech Act / Dialog Act Classification** using recent taxonomies and LLM judges.  
- **Hybrid Evaluation Pipeline** (automatic metrics + human-in-the-loop).  
- **Native xAI Integration**: Grok-4.3 reasoning modes, tool calling, real-time search for context validation.

**Target Users**  
Journalists, analysts, researchers, educators, content moderators, legal teams, AI safety engineers, and power users who want to “see through” language.

### 2. Background, Motivation & Research Foundation

**Original Motivation (from user history)**  
Language serves communication, but always with purpose, hidden intent, multiple angles, and moral implications. The 6-phase DIA provides a repeatable algorithm.

**2025–2026 Research Integration** (selected key sources)

- **Pragmatics in the Era of LLMs Survey** (arXiv:2502.12378): Comprehensive datasets for speech acts, implicature, social pragmatics; highlights LLM gaps in deeper pragmatic reasoning and English-centric bias. Recommends hybrid evaluation and theory-grounded prompting.

- **Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC)** (arXiv:2503.01539): 4-step relevance-theory-based prompting dramatically improves implicit toxicity / hidden bias detection (GPT-4o: +12.26 pp). Explicitly separates literal meaning, metaphors, norm violation, and judgment. Directly enhances Phase 3 & 4.

- **Multi-Party Conversational Agents Survey** (arXiv:2505.18845): State-of-Mind taxonomy (Emotion, Engagement, Personality Big-Five, Dialog Acts); discourse structure; Theory of Mind (ToM) for multi-perspective modeling. Enables true multi-angle simulation.

- **Gricean Maxims in NLP & Human-AI Interaction**: Multiple papers extend Grice with Benevolence & Transparency maxims for AI; use maxim-violation detection for offensive/hidden-agenda texts.

- **xAI / Grok Research**: Grok-4.3 excels at agentic tool use, long-context reasoning, low hallucination, and social role mediation (truth arbiter, adversary). Ideal backbone for DIA as a trustworthy, multi-role analysis agent.

These findings directly upgrade the original framework into a **scientifically grounded, computationally implementable specification**.

### 4. Detailed Functional Requirements – 6 Phases (v2.0 Enhanced)

#### Phase 0: Context Analyzer
**Inputs**: Raw text, optional metadata (sender, platform, date, prior messages).  
**Processing**: LLM extracts sender power/relationship, audience, medium norms, trigger event; bias self-check prompt.  
**Enhancement**: Real-time search tool for historical/cultural context.  
**Output**: Structured context object + confidence.

#### Phase 1: Purpose Categorization (Jakobson Functions)
**Table** (unchanged but now LLM-ranked with evidence): Referential, Emotive, Conative, Phatic, Metalingual, Poetic.  
**v2.0**: Multi-label classification with probability distribution + justification.

#### Phase 2: Surface Literal Analysis
**Checklist** (facts vs opinions, loaded words, voice, omissions, ambiguity).  
**Enhancement**: Embedding-based vagueness scoring + coreference resolution.

#### Phase 3: Pragmatic & Speech Act Engine (Core Upgrade)
**Components**:
- **Searle’s 5 Categories** (Assertives, Directives, Commissives, Expressives, Declaratives) + fine-grained taxonomies from Parliamentary Debates & CyberAgressionAdo-v2 (“attack”, “defend”, etc.).
- **Grice Maxim Violation Detector**: Automated scoring (Quantity, Quality, Relation, Manner) + extended maxims (Benevolence, Transparency).
- **PIC Integration** (mandatory for hidden agenda):
  1. Explain metaphors/special meanings (layperson language).
  2. Literal meaning (layperson language).
  3. Identify contradictions with relevant social/ethical norms (equality, truth-seeking, non-manipulation, etc.).
  4. Final implicature judgment.

**Output per utterance**: `{illocutionary_act, perlocutionary_effect, maxim_violations: [...], implicature: "...", confidence}`

#### Phase 4: Hidden Agenda & Multi-Angle Dissection (Major Upgrade)
**Steps**:
1. Explicit vs Implicit goals (power, status, division, validation…).
2. Power & ideology scan (CDA-style: who benefits? us vs them?).
3. **Multi-Perspective Agent Simulation** (new): Spawn 4–6 parallel Grok agents, each embodying one POV (speaker, receiver, opponent, society, historical, environmental). Each produces angle summary + evidence. Aggregate with clustering.
4. Framing analysis + inconsistency detection.
5. Agenda Type classification (Inform / Persuade / Manipulate / Bond / Signal / Deceive) with sub-scores.

**Output**: `hidden_agenda: str, angle_count: int, angles: [{perspective, framing, evidence}], ignored_angles: [...]`

#### Phase 5: Behavioral Judgment Engine
**6 Core Dimensions** (1–10 or 0–1) + 2 new:
1. Truthfulness
2. Ethical Impact (harm, autonomy, power imbalance)
3. Effectiveness (stated + hidden goals)
4. Clarity & Cooperation (Grice)
5. Social Value (understanding vs division)
6. Transparency
7. **Benevolence** (new – AI-specific)
8. **Cultural Appropriateness** (new – from multi-task pragmatic models)

**Final Verdict**: Categorical + narrative + recommended action.  
**Rule**: All scores must cite evidence from Phases 0–4.

#### Phase 6: Synthesis
One-paragraph executive summary + actionable recommendations + confidence vector.  
Optional: Counter-argument generator or “how to respond” module.

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: <15s for <5k token text on Grok-4.3 high reasoning; parallel phase execution.  
- **Scalability**: Stateless API; batch mode for enterprise (1000s of texts).  
- **Accuracy**: Target >85% agreement with expert linguists on speech act + implicature benchmarks (use Parliamentary Debates, PIC test sets, etc.).  
- **Explainability**: Every claim has evidence span + confidence.  
- **Ethics & Safety**: Built-in refusal for harmful misuse; bias auditing; xAI alignment principles (truth-seeking, helpfulness without sycophancy).  
- **Privacy**: Optional local mode; no persistent storage of user texts unless opted in.

### 8. Evaluation Framework

- **Automatic**: F1 on speech act datasets, PIC accuracy lift, Grice violation detection correlation with human labels.  
- **Human**: Expert linguist agreement (Cohen’s κ > 0.75 target).  
- **A/B Testing**: DIA vs baseline LLM on real-world texts (news, ads, political speech, X posts).  
- **xAI-Specific**: Measure reduction in sycophancy / hallucination in judgment phase.

### 9. Limitations & Future Work

**Current Limitations**  
- English-dominant (mitigate with multilingual PIC prompts).  
- Requires high-quality context for best results.  
- Computational cost on very long documents (mitigated by 1M context + summarization agents).

**Future**  
- Multimodal extension (video/audio discourse).  
- Real-time conversation monitoring (multi-party).  
- Fine-tuned DIA-specialist model on xAI infrastructure.  
- Open-source benchmark suite contribution to arXiv community.
