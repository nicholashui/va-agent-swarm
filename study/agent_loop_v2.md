# Refined Agent Loop: Hierarchical, ReAct-Inspired, Production-Grade Design

**Version:** 2026-06-07 (Updated with comprehensive research on known agent loop failure modes from MASFT taxonomy & related studies, plus targeted mitigations from Reflexion, critic frameworks, structured specs, memory architectures, and production patterns)  
**Research Sources**: "Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?" (MASFT taxonomy, 14-18 failure modes), Reflexion, Prospector, CGI, memory papers, xAI docs, and developer reports on infinite loops/context issues.
**Purpose:** Actionable reference for building reliable, scalable LLM-based agent systems. Combines academic foundations (ReAct synergy of reasoning + acting), xAI's server-side agentic implementation (multi-agent orchestration for deep research), and advanced hierarchical patterns (planner + specialists + self-evolution).  
**Target Audience:** Builders of harnesses, multi-agent systems, coding agents, research agents (e.g., N1ch01as-style Architect with critic/self-refinement loops).  
**Key Principle:** Controlled loops with explicit state, structured outputs, quality gates, and hierarchical delegation. Not uncontrolled chain reactions — managed orchestration with bubbling-up consolidation and deliberate synthesis.

## 1. Core Principles (Refined from Research)

### 1.1 Foundational: ReAct Paradigm (Yao et al., ICLR 2023)
- **Definition**: Interleave **verbal reasoning traces (Thoughts)** with **actions** (tool calls, environment interactions, or delegation). Observations from actions ground and update reasoning.
- **Why it works**:
  - Pure Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Static, prone to hallucinations and error propagation (no external grounding).
  - Pure Acting: No high-level planning, poor exception handling, inefficient trajectories.
  - **ReAct synergy**: Thoughts decompose goals, track progress, handle exceptions, and replan. Actions provide real observations that correct reasoning and enable adaptation. Results in 10-34% gains on interactive tasks and reduced hallucinations on knowledge tasks.
- **Basic Cycle** (one iteration):
  1. **Thought**: LLM reasons about current state, goal, progress, next step, or exception. (Internal, updates context.)
  2. **Action**: Decide and output executable step (tool call with args, sub-agent delegation, or `Finish`/`Done`).
  3. **Observation**: Environment / tool / sub-agent returns structured result (data + metadata: status, confidence, summary, issues).
  4. Append to history/state → repeat.
- **Prompt Structure** (few-shot examples essential): Dense thoughts for reasoning-heavy tasks (QA/research); sparser for embodied/decision tasks. Use explicit tags or JSON schema for parseability.
- **Exception Handling**: Thought step detects failure ("Nothing useful returned") → replans or adjusts action in next iteration.

**xAI Alignment**: Grok's server-side agentic tool calling implements a production ReAct-style loop internally. The model decides tools, executes server-side (web_search, x_search, code_execution, collections_search), iterates until it can produce the final answer. Client sees only final (or streamed) output + optional reasoning tokens.

### 1.2 Production xAI Multi-Agent Orchestration (2026)
- **grok-4.20-multi-agent** (or equivalent): Launches configurable teams (4 agents for quick/focused; 16 for deep/comprehensive).
- **How the loop works**:
  - Server-side **realtime collaboration**: Multiple specialized agents run in parallel.
  - Each contributes reasoning, tool calls, findings.
  - **Leader agent** synthesizes discussion, cross-references, and delivers final structured answer.
  - Parallel tool invocation and iteration based on intermediate findings.
  - Sub-agent internal states encrypted/hidden by default (control + security); only leader outputs + (optionally) encrypted content exposed.
- **Strengths**: Deep multi-step research, structured outputs (tables, comparisons), realtime refinement, automatic tool use without client intervention in the loop.
- **Plan-first elements**: Complementary patterns in xAI tools like Grok Build CLI use explicit plan generation first, then parallel sub-agent execution (e.g., up to 8 sub-agents in isolated Git worktrees).

### 1.3 Hierarchical + Self-Evolving (AgentOrchestra / Surveys 2025-2026)
- **Central Planner / Orchestrator / Supervisor** at top level.
- Decomposes into sub-tasks → delegates to **specialized sub-agents** (Deep Researcher, Analyzer, Browser/Tool agents, Reporter, etc.).
- Each sub-agent runs its **own loop** (ReAct-style or domain-optimized).
- **Tree-structured routing** + results bubble up.
- **TEA Protocol inspiration** (Tool-Environment-Agent): Treat tools, environments, and agents as first-class, versioned, lifecycle-managed entities with standardized protocols for context, invocation, and evolution.
- **Closed feedback / Self-evolution**:
  - Reflection (verbal self-critique on traces).
  - Trace-based optimization (e.g., TextGrad-style: attribute errors → propose edits → validate on held-out → version/register).
  - Version manager: Register improved prompts/tools/agents; support rollback/select best.
  - Tracer for full execution trajectories (auditability + optimization signal).
- **Consolidation**: Planner aggregates sub-results, harmonizes evidence, resolves conflicts, updates global plan/state, or triggers refinement. Dedicated Reporter agent often handles final synthesis with citations/deduplication.
- **Performance evidence**: AgentOrchestra-style systems reach 89%+ on GAIA benchmark; sub-agents + self-evolution add double-digit gains; hierarchical routing improves scalability vs flat multi-agent.

**Overall Refined Model**: Start with ReAct core loop. Layer hierarchical delegation for complexity. Add explicit planning phase + reflection/critique gates + structured state/versioning for production reliability. xAI shows this can run server-side with strong orchestration primitives.

## 1.4 Known Problems, Failure Modes & Targeted Mitigations (Research-Backed)

Recent systematic studies (especially the **MASFT taxonomy** from analysis of 150+ traces across popular multi-agent frameworks) identify that **most failures stem from design/spec issues (~40%+)**, coordination breakdowns, and weak verification/termination — **not raw model intelligence**. Single-agent ReAct loops suffer overlapping issues plus context bloat and repetitive behavior. Below is a synthesized taxonomy of the most common, well-documented problems, with **actionable mitigations** mapped directly to the phases in this document.

### Major Problem Categories & Frequency/Significance
1. **Specification & Design Ambiguities (Largest Category)**
   - Disobeying or misinterpreting task spec, vague roles, missing success criteria or output contracts.
   - **Impact**: Agents go off-track early; errors compound downstream.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Phase 0: Mandatory structured Task Specification with explicit success criteria, constraints, output schema, and quality thresholds. Use "living spec" that can be updated.
     - Add automated spec validation (critic or schema check) before loop starts.
     - Clear role definitions and information contracts between orchestrator and sub-agents.

2. **Infinite Loops, Repetitive Actions & Thrashing**
   - Agent repeats the same (or similar) actions without progress; common in ReAct from poor exception handling or missing info; can be induced by prompt injection.
   - **Impact**: Wasted tokens/cost, timeouts, frustration (frequent real-world complaint).
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Phase 1 loop: Add **cycle detection** (state hashing of recent actions + observations; if similarity > threshold, force replan or terminate).
     - Explicit `max_steps`, `max_reflection_rounds`, and progress-based early exit (e.g., todo completion %).
     - Bounded reflection: Limit "improve this" iterations.
     - `Done` / `Finish` tool with mandatory verification before acceptance.
     - In hierarchical: Orchestrator monitors sub-agent progress and can kill/reassign stuck branches.

3. **Context Window Explosion / Context Rot / History Bloat**
   - Long trajectories cause key early info or instructions to be dropped; leads to inconsistency, repetition, goal drift.
   - **Impact**: Degraded performance in long-running or multi-turn tasks.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Aggressive hierarchical memory: Short-term working memory + long-term persistent store (vector search, semantic caching, MemGPT-style).
     - Summarization at milestones or when context > threshold (signal-aware truncation).
     - Structured state (`task.md`, todo list, key facts only) instead of dumping full history every turn.
     - Sub-agents receive only relevant context slices + provenance.

4. **Hallucinations, Error Compounding & Verification Weakness**
   - Fabricated facts, incorrect tool results interpretation, or unverified claims propagating (worse in multi-agent).
   - **Impact**: Unreliable final outputs; cascading failures.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - **Verifier / Critic agents** as mandatory quality gates (Phase 3 consolidation and after sub-results).
     - Structured observation schema (status, confidence, issues list) + cross-validation (compare across agents/sources).
     - Multi-form verification (factual grounding in observations + external checks).
     - Trajectory ranking (e.g., Prospector-style critic selects best among multiple attempts).
     - In self-evolution: Only commit changes validated on held-out traces.

5. **Inter-Agent Misalignment & Coordination Failures (Multi-Agent Specific)**
   - Role overstepping, conflicting goals, stale state sharing, communication gaps, error propagation between agents.
   - **Impact**: Poor collaboration; sometimes single strong agent outperforms complex MAS.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Strong central **Orchestrator/Planner** with explicit decomposition and routing (hierarchical control beats flat).
     - Information contracts + structured handoff formats.
     - Versioned shared state + durable coordination primitives (e.g., streams, pub/sub).
     - Circuit breakers: Detect inconsistency → pause, reconcile, or escalate.
     - Clear "Extreme hierarchical differentiation" (well-defined specialist roles).

6. **Termination & Goal Drift Problems**
   - Premature stopping (incomplete work) or failure to recognize completion; agents continue or give up wrongly.
   - **Impact**: Wrong or partial results.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Explicit success criteria in spec + progress tracking against them.
     - Dedicated termination action (`Done` tool) that must pass verifier.
     - Periodic alignment checks in Thought step vs original objective.
     - Early termination signals when intermediate results satisfy criteria.

7. **Other Notable Issues**
   - **State staleness & memory failures**: Use hybrid memory (fast short-term + persistent long-term with retrieval).
   - **Security (prompt injection → loops or misuse)**: Sandbox tools, input sanitization, least-privilege tool access, monitoring for anomalous loops.
   - **Cost & scalability overhead**: Multi-agent only when benefit > coordination cost; monitor token usage per phase; parallel where safe.
   - **Debuggability**: Full tracer + structured logs are non-negotiable.

### How Mitigations Integrate into the Loop Phases
- **Phase 0 (Init)**: Spec engineering + validation is the single highest-ROI fix.
- **Phase 1 (Core Loop)**: Cycle detection, bounded steps/reflection, structured observations, progress tracking.
- **Phase 2 (Delegation)**: Narrow sub-specs + contracts; orchestrator monitoring.
- **Phase 3 (Consolidation)**: Verifier/critic gates, cross-validation, harmonization.
- **Phase 4 (Reflection/Self-evolution)**: Validation before applying changes; bounded loops.
- **Phase 5 (Termination)**: Verifier + explicit Done with evidence.

**Key Insight from Research**: Fixing **specification quality + verification layers + explicit termination controls** delivers the largest reliability gains. Adding more agents or raw model power without these often yields diminishing or negative returns.

## 2. The Complete Agent Loop Process (Actionable)

### Phase 0: Initialization (Spec-Driven Setup)
**Goal**: Establish clear contract before any loop iterations.
1. Parse human instruction → generate/validate **Task Specification** (structured: objective, success criteria, constraints, output format, max budget/steps/tokens, quality thresholds).
2. Create **initial state**:
   - `task.md` or structured scratchpad (current plan, todo list, progress, open questions).
   - Memory: Short-term (recent observations), long-term (retrieved knowledge, past versions).
   - Tracer / execution log (for later reflection).
   - Version registry (for prompts/tools/agents if evolving).
3. **Optional Plan Generation** (Plan-and-Execute flavor, recommended for complex tasks):
   - Orchestrator LLM generates high-level plan (numbered steps or dependency graph).
   - Validate plan against spec (self-critique or dedicated critic).
   - Store in state.
4. Decide architecture: Flat ReAct (simple) vs Hierarchical (complex research/coding) vs Hybrid.

**Actionable Output Format** (example JSON or Markdown section):
```json
{
  "task_id": "...",
  "objective": "...",
  "success_criteria": ["...", "..."],
  "constraints": ["max_steps: 50", "budget_tokens: 200k"],
  "output_format": "structured report with citations",
  "initial_plan": ["Step 1: ...", "Step 2: ..."],
  "quality_gates": ["completeness > 90%", "no hallucinations", "structured output"]
}
```

### Phase 1: Core Iteration Loop (ReAct-Inspired, Controlled)
While not terminated:
1. **Observe Current State**: Load full/relevant history + task spec + current plan/todo + latest observations. (Summarize aggressively if context long — use memory manager.)
2. **Reason (Thought)**:
   - Analyze progress vs success criteria.
   - Identify gaps, risks, exceptions.
   - Decide strategy: direct tool, delegate sub-task, synthesize so far, reflect/critique, or finish.
   - Update internal plan or todo if needed.
3. **Act / Decide Next** (strict structured output — parseable):
   - **Option A (Tool)**: Call built-in or custom tool (with args). xAI-style: server handles execution in loop.
   - **Option B (Delegate)**: Invoke sub-agent with narrow sub-instruction + context slice + success criteria for that sub-task. (Hierarchical)
   - **Option C (Internal)**: Update state/plan only, or run critic on draft.
   - **Option D (Finish)**: Output final answer if quality gates passed.
4. **Execute & Observe**:
   - Run action (tool or sub-agent loop).
   - Collect **structured observation**:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success | partial | failed",
       "data": {...},
       "summary": "concise natural language",
       "confidence": 0.85,
       "issues": ["list of problems"],
       "next_suggestions": ["..."],
       "trace_id": "..."
     }
     ```
   - Append to history + update todo/state.
5. **Light Reflection** (every N steps or on failure): Quick self-critique — "Is this trajectory still aligned? Any obvious fix?"

**Circuit Breaker Pattern (Recommended for Production)**

Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures when a tool, LLM call, or sub-agent is repeatedly failing. They have three states:
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests go through.
- **OPEN**: Too many failures → fast-fail immediately (protects the system).
- **HALF_OPEN**: After timeout, allow limited test requests to check recovery.

Use one circuit breaker per tool type or per sub-agent role. Integrate with the retry wrappers below.

def verify_output(candidate: dict, task_spec: dict, llm) -> dict:
    prompt = VERIFIER_PROMPT.format(
        task_spec=task_spec, 
        candidate_output=candidate
    )
    result = llm.generate(prompt, output_schema=...)  # force JSON
    return result
```

**Code Example: Simple Self-Evolution / Reflection Step (Trace → Edit → Validate)**

```python
def self_evolve_component(component_name: str, trace: List[dict], llm, version_manager):
    """Minimal TextGrad / reflection-style evolution"""
    diagnosis = llm.generate(
        f"Analyze this execution trace and identify the root cause of any failures or inefficiencies:\n{trace}",
        output_schema={"root_cause": str, "target_component": str, "proposed_edit": str}
    )
    
    if diagnosis.target_component == component_name:
        new_version = apply_edit(component_name, diagnosis.proposed_edit)
        # Validate on held-out or re-execution
        if validate_improvement(new_version, trace):
            version_manager.register(new_version, parent=component_name)
            return new_version
    return None  # no change or rollback
```

**Termination Conditions** (checked every iteration or at gates):
- Success criteria met + quality gate passed.
- Max steps / token budget / time reached.
- Explicit `Done` / `Finish` action with validated output.
- Irrecoverable failure (escalate to human or higher orchestrator).
- Early exit if intermediate result satisfies objective.

### Phase 2: Hierarchical Delegation & Sub-Loops
When orchestrator decides to delegate:
1. **Decompose & Route**:
   - Planner selects or instantiates appropriate sub-agent type (specialist role, toolset, prompt template).
   - Creates narrow sub-task spec (subset of parent objective + relevant context slice).
   - Invokes sub-agent (can be same LLM with different system prompt/role, or different model).
2. **Sub-Agent Runs Independent Loop**:
   - Sub-agent executes its own ReAct-style iterations (or optimized variant) against its sub-spec.
   - Maintains local state/memory.
   - Can further delegate (tree) or call tools.
3. **Return Structured Result** to parent (bubbles up):
   - Same structured observation format above.
   - Includes provenance (which sub-agent, trace summary).
4. **Parent Handles**:
   - Records in global state/tracer.
   - Validates/integrates (merge with other branches, resolve conflicts via harmonization step).
   - Updates global plan/todo.
   - Decides next: more delegation, direct action, consolidate, or critique.

**Parallelism**: Where dependencies allow (e.g., independent research branches), run multiple sub-agents/tools concurrently (xAI multi-agent style or worktree isolation like Grok Build).

### Phase 3: Consolidation, Synthesis & Restructuring
After sub-results or major milestones:
1. **Aggregate**: Collect all relevant observations + plan progress.
2. **Harmonize**: LLM (or dedicated Reporter agent) merges, deduplicates, cross-references, resolves contradictions. Produces unified view.
3. **Restructure**: Transform into target output shape (report, code, answer, updated plan). Enforce format from initial spec.
4. **Quality Gate**:
   - Run critic/refiner: Score against success criteria, check for hallucinations/gaps, suggest fixes.
   - If fails: Trigger refinement loop (re-plan, re-delegate specific parts, or self-edit).
   - If passes: Proceed (or do final polish).
5. **Update State**: Persist consolidated knowledge to long-term memory / versioned artifacts.

**Example Consolidator Prompt Snippet**:
"You are a synthesis expert. Given the original task spec, current plan, and these sub-results [structured list], produce: 1) Updated progress summary. 2) Any conflicts resolved. 3) Draft final output section. 4) Remaining gaps and recommended next actions."

### Phase 4: Reflection, Critique & Self-Evolution (Advanced)
- **Per-trajectory or milestone reflection**: LLM summarizes trace, diagnoses failures/successes, proposes improvements (prompt edits, tool patches, new sub-agent types).
- **Self-evolution loop** (inspired by AgentOrchestra):
  1. Collect trace via tracer.
  2. Attribute errors / opportunities (LLM or TextGrad-style).
  3. Propose targeted changes (to prompts, tools, agent configs, or even generated code).
  4. Validate changes (re-execute on held-out or similar task; check metrics).
  5. If improved: Register new version (with lineage). Support rollback.
- **Critic Agent Role**: Separate lightweight agent that reviews drafts/plans without full execution. Can be invoked at gates.
- **Benefits**: Continuous improvement during runtime; production systems become more robust over repeated use on similar task distributions.

### Phase 5: Termination & Output
- When gates passed or termination condition met:
  1. Final synthesis pass.
  2. Structured final output (match spec).
  3. Optional: Post-hoc reflection summary for user or logging.
  4. Persist full trace + versions for audit/replay/debug.
- **Human-in-loop hooks**: At quality gate failures, high-stakes actions, or budget exhaustion.

## 3. State, Memory & Infrastructure Recommendations

- **State Schema**: task_spec + current_plan/todo + history (thought/action/observation tuples) + memory (key-value or vector) + versions + tracer.
- **Memory Management**: Hierarchical (local per sub-agent + global). Summarization on context pressure. Session-isolated for concurrency.
- **Tracing**: Full execution graph (who called what, results, timings, versions). Enables debugging, reflection, and optimization.
- **Versioning** (TEA-inspired): Prompts, tools, agent roles, generated artifacts — all versioned with semantic lineage and rollback.
- **xAI Integration Tips**:
  - Use Grok multi-agent mode for research-heavy top-level tasks.
  - Mix server-side agentic tools with client-side custom tools (hybrid).
  - For coding agents: Adopt plan-first + parallel sub-agents in isolated environments (worktrees).
  - Stream reasoning tokens when possible for transparency.
- **Production Hardening**:
  - Strict output schemas (JSON mode or constrained decoding).
  - Timeouts, retry with backoff, circuit breakers on failing tools/sub-agents.
  - Cost/token budgets + monitoring.
  - Logging + observability (every thought/action/observation).
  - Sandboxed execution for tools/code.

## 4. Decision Framework (When to Use What)

| Task Complexity       | Recommended Pattern                  | Key Features to Enable          | Example Use Case |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Simple fact lookup    | Flat ReAct (single loop)            | Tool calling, basic thought    | Quick search + answer |
| Multi-step research   | xAI Multi-Agent or Hierarchical     | Parallel agents, leader synth  | Deep analysis with sources |
| Coding / long project | Plan-first + Hierarchical + Worktrees | Sub-agents in isolation, todo.md | Full app generation + debug |
| Open-ended / creative | ReAct + Reflection + Self-evolution | Critic gates, versioned prompts| Iterative design refinement |
| High-stakes / reliable| All above + strong Quality Gates    | Structured results, validation | Enterprise automation |

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Mitigations (from Research)

**Primary reference: See the full MASFT-style taxonomy, failure modes, and phase-specific mitigations in the new Section 1.4 above.** The points below are retained for quick scanning and now include additional patterns from recent studies.

- **Context explosion**: Aggressive summarization + hierarchical state (local sub-memories).
- **Infinite loops / thrashing**: Hard max iterations + progress tracking in todo + critic that can force replan or escalate.
- **Poor consolidation**: Mandate structured sub-results + dedicated harmonization/reporter step.
- **Hallucinations in plans**: Ground every major claim in observations; use critic before committing to plan.
- **Brittle delegation**: Use explicit sub-task specs + success criteria; validate returned results.
- **Lack of visibility**: Full tracing + optional streaming of reasoning.

## 6. Quick-Start Pseudocode Skeleton (Python-like)

```python
def agent_loop(task_instruction, tools, sub_agent_registry, max_steps=50):
    state = initialize_state(task_instruction)  # spec, plan, todo, memory, tracer
    orchestrator = get_llm(role="orchestrator")
    
    while not should_terminate(state, max_steps):
        # 1. Observe
        context = build_context(state)
        
        # 2. Reason + Decide
        decision = orchestrator.generate(
            prompt=build_decision_prompt(context, state.spec),
            output_schema=DECISION_SCHEMA  # thought, action_type, payload
        )
        
        if decision.action_type == "tool":
            obs = execute_tool(decision.payload, tools)
        elif decision.action_type == "delegate":
            sub_result = invoke_sub_agent(decision.payload, sub_agent_registry)  # runs its own loop
            obs = structured_observation_from(sub_result)
        elif decision.action_type == "synthesize":
            obs = consolidate_and_gate(state)
        elif decision.action_type == "finish":
            return finalize_output(state, decision)
        
        # 3. Update state
        state.history.append(decision.thought, decision, obs)
        state = update_todo_and_plan(state, obs)
        
        # 4. Optional light reflection or full self-evolution pass
        if should_reflect(state):
            state = reflect_and_evolve(state)  # critique + version updates
    
    return handle_termination(state)
```

Sub-agent invoke follows the same pattern recursively (narrower scope).
