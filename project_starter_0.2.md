# Project Starter — Improved Living Task Spec  
  
**Project name:** `project_starter`    
**Package/repo name:** `project_starter`    
**Version:** `0.2.0-rethink`    
**Status:** Ready for Phase 0 execution    
**Created:** 2026-06-07    
**Primary objective:** Build a production-ready starter repo that installs, synchronizes, audits, and evolves a cross-agent coding harness for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Grok Build, and similar tools.  
  
---  
  
## 0. Key Rethink Summary  
  
The original plan is strong but broad, partially duplicative, and slightly risky because it assumes “full installs” and “exact parity” across tools whose config systems differ. This improved spec makes the project more executable by:  
  
1. Making **ECC the foundation**, but installing curated profiles first instead of blindly copying everything.  
2. Replacing Bash-first sync with a **cross-platform Node.js CLI**.  
3. Defining **one source of truth** and generated adapters with drift checks.  
4. Treating “same skills/rules everywhere” as **semantic parity**, not identical file format parity.  
5. Adding license, source, checksum, and version manifests.  
6. Separating **instructions**, **skills**, **memory**, **hooks**, **MCP**, and **generated tool configs**.  
7. Adding an explicit **security threat model**.  
8. Replacing “log all reasoning traces” with **auditable summaries, evidence, decisions, diffs, commands, test results, and review outputs**. Do not request or store hidden chain-of-thought.  
9. Making self-improvement **proposal-only until human approval**.  
10. Adding measurable quality gates, sync tests, and install-time budgets.  
  
---  
  
## 1. Source Verification Snapshot  
  
Phase 0 must re-check all sources before implementation. Current intended source priorities:  
  
1. **ECC** — primary cross-agent harness foundation.  
2. **Karpathy-style behavioral rules** — concise behavioral layer.  
3. **claude-mem or equivalent** — persistent memory if compatible and safe.  
4. **Claude Code best-practice repositories** — selected planning/workflow patterns.  
5. **Curated skill libraries** — selective import only; no bulk install by default.  
6. **Official agent docs** — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Grok Build, GitHub Copilot.  
  
Phase 0 must verify:  
  
- Latest version, commit, tag, or release.  
- License.  
- Installation method.  
- Supported config paths.  
- Security implications.  
- What is included, adapted, or rejected.  
  
---  
  
## 2. Non-Negotiable Principles  
  
1. **SDD first:** Specs drive implementation.  
2. **ECC-first on overlap:** Prefer ECC components, naming, conventions, security, and cross-harness architecture unless a source audit proves a better fit.  
3. **Karpathy behavior layer:** Think before coding, simplicity first, surgical changes, goal-driven execution.  
4. **Single source of truth:** Central `skills/`, `rules/`, `hooks/`, `mcp-configs/`, and manifests are authoritative.  
5. **Generated adapters:** `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, etc. are generated or documented from the source of truth.  
6. **Safe by default:** No destructive automation, remote MCP, or skill mutation without explicit human approval.  
7. **Local-first:** Prefer local scripts, local memory, local audit logs, and optional external services.  
8. **Minimal core, optional bundles:** Starter must be lean; large skill libraries are curated, not fully installed.  
9. **Cross-platform:** macOS, Linux, Windows/PowerShell/WSL where possible.  
10. **Auditable, not opaque:** Store concise rationales, evidence, decisions, diffs, commands run, test results, and review summaries. Do **not** require hidden chain-of-thought.

## 5. Generated File Policy  
  
Every generated/adapted file must include a header:  
  
```text  
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED by project_starter. Do not edit directly.  
Source: skills/, rules/, hooks/, mcp-configs/  
Run: npm run sync  
-->  
```  
  
Rules:  
  
- [ ] Central files are authoritative.  
- [ ] Generated files are overwritten only after conflict checks.  
- [ ] Local user files are backed up before overwrite.  
- [ ] `--dry-run` must show exact writes/deletes.  
- [ ] `--check` must fail if generated files are stale.  
- [ ] Symlinks are preferred only where safe and supported.  
- [ ] Windows fallback is copy mode unless Developer Mode/admin symlink support is detected.  
  
---  
  
## 6. Phase 0 — Research, Scope Lock, and Source Audit  
  
**Goal:** Confirm latest sources, install commands, licenses, and compatibility before generating files.  
  
### Tasks  
  
- [ ] Verify latest ECC release, installer commands, profiles, and license.  
- [ ] Verify Karpathy-style rules source and Cursor rule variant.  
- [ ] Verify `claude-mem` or equivalent persistent-memory candidate.  
- [ ] Verify best-practice workflow repositories and select only non-duplicative patterns.  
- [ ] Verify curated skill libraries and choose only high-value bundles.  
- [ ] Verify official docs for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Grok Build, and GitHub Copilot.  
- [ ] Create `docs/source-audit.md` with:  
  - source name  
  - URL  
  - version/commit/tag  
  - license  
  - install command  
  - selected components  
  - rejected components  
  - rationale  
- [ ] Create `docs/decisions.md` with ADR-style decisions.  
- [ ] Define starter profiles:  
  - **Core profile:** minimal, safe, under 5-minute init.  
  - **Power profile:** ECC broader install + memory + curated skills.  
  - **Experimental profile:** Grok Build, extra MCP, multi-agent demos.  
  
### Acceptance Criteria  
  
- [ ] No source is used without license and version/commit recorded.  
- [ ] No conflicting duplicate skills/rules are accepted.  
- [ ] Clear priority order exists: ECC > Karpathy > memory > best-practice > curated libraries.  
- [ ] Install commands are verified before scripting.  
  
---  
  
## 7. Phase 1 — Repo Skeleton and CLI Foundation  
  
**Goal:** Create a clean starter repo with portable scripts.

  - required directories  
- [ ] Add `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and base docs.  
- [ ] Add empty manifests with JSON schemas.  
- [ ] Add first `task.md` and `status.md`.  
  
### Acceptance Criteria  
  
- [ ] `npm run doctor` works on a clean machine.  
- [ ] `npm run test` passes with placeholder tests.  
- [ ] Repo skeleton can be created in under 1 minute.  
- [ ] All docs and generated headers use `project_starter`.  
  
---  
  
## 8. Phase 2 — ECC Foundation  
  
**Goal:** Install/adapt ECC as the primary harness layer.  
  
### Tasks

- [ ] Support profiles:  
  - `--profile core`  
  - `--profile minimal`  
  - `--profile power`  
  - `--profile experimental`  
- [ ] Install/select ECC components:  
  - core rules  
  - planning/review/security skills  
  - AgentShield/security scan  
  - token/context optimization  
  - memory/instinct learning where safe  
  - dmux or parallel orchestration patterns  
  - MCP conventions  
- [ ] Avoid blind full copy by default.  
- [ ] Record ECC source version in `docs/source-audit.md`.  
- [ ] Add attribution to imported/derived files.  
- [ ] Run AgentShield/security scan after ECC setup.  
  
### Acceptance Criteria  
  
- [ ] ECC core profile is installed or referenced reproducibly.  
- [ ] Security scan runs.  
- [ ] No oversized skill dump is loaded by default.  
- [ ] ECC is the default conflict winner.  
  
---  
  
## 9. Phase 3 — Behavioral Rules and SDD Constitution  
  
**Goal:** Create concise, high-impact rules that every agent receives.  
  
### Central Rule Files

- [ ] `rules/40-testing.md`  
- [ ] `rules/50-token-efficiency.md`  
- [ ] `rules/60-human-approval.md`  
  
### Required Behavioral Layer  
  
- [ ] Think before coding.  
- [ ] Prefer simple solutions.  
- [ ] Make surgical changes.  
- [ ] Execute against the stated goal.  
- [ ] Ask only when blocked by meaningful ambiguity.  
- [ ] Plan before multi-file edits.  
- [ ] Run tests or explain why tests were not run.  
- [ ] Update `status.md` after major work.  
- [ ] Never auto-apply skill/rule/hook changes without human approval.  
  
### Acceptance Criteria  
  
- [ ] `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, and tool adapters receive semantically identical behavior.  
- [ ] Rules remain concise and non-duplicative.  
- [ ] All rule conflicts are documented.  
  
---  
  
## 10. Phase 4 — Curated Skills

- [ ] Skills are tested through sync adapters.  
  
---  
  
## 11. Phase 5 — Cross-Agent Synchronization Layer  
  
**Goal:** Make every supported agent receive the same curated skills, rules, hooks, and MCP configuration as far as each tool supports.  
  
### CLI

npm run sync -- --check  
npm run sync -- --mode auto  
npm run sync -- --mode copy  
npm run sync -- --mode symlink  
npm run sync -- --select planning,review,security  
```  
  
### Adapter Targets  
  
- [ ] Claude Code:  
  - `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`  
  - `.claude/rules/*.md`  
  - `.claude/settings.json`  
  - `.claude/commands/` compatibility shims where useful  
  - root `CLAUDE.md`  
- [ ] Cursor:  
  - `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`

- [ ] At least Claude Code + Cursor + Codex/Gemini are tested.  
- [ ] No manual copying is required.  
  
---  
  
## 12. Phase 6 — Memory and Handoff  
  
**Goal:** Provide persistent, privacy-aware memory without context bloat.  
  
### Memory Layers  
  
- [ ] `status.md`: current progress.  
- [ ] `task.md`: living spec.

- [ ] `memory/handoff.md`: compact continuation summary.  
- [ ] `memory/reflections/`: review lessons and repeated patterns.  
- [ ] Optional `claude-mem` or ECC memory/instinct layer.  
  
### Rules  
  
- [ ] Never store secrets.  
- [ ] Redact credentials and personal data.  
- [ ] Summarize instead of dumping logs.  
- [ ] Load only relevant memory.  
- [ ] Prefer handoff files for session continuation.  
- [ ] Keep auto-injected context small.  
  
### Acceptance Criteria  
  
- [ ] A new session can resume from `task.md`, `status.md`, and `memory/handoff.md`.  
- [ ] Self-review outputs can generate reflection entries.  
- [ ] Memory can be disabled.

- [ ] Claude skill/command: `/self-review`  
- [ ] Claude skill/command: `/critic`  
- [ ] CLI: `npm run review`  
- [ ] Optional hook: post-task self-review  
  
### Guardrails  
  
- [ ] No hidden chain-of-thought logging.  
- [ ] Store concise rationale and evidence only.  
- [ ] Max 2 refine loops by default.  
- [ ] Human confirmation for high-impact changes.  
  
### Acceptance Criteria

## 20. Implementation Priority  
  
1. **Foundation:** repo, CLI, manifests, docs skeleton.  
2. **Sync:** central source → Claude/Cursor/Codex.  
3. **ECC:** install/adapt core.  
4. **Rules:** constitution + Karpathy + SDD.  
5. **Skills:** curated core.  
6. **Security:** AgentShield + secret protections.  
7. **Memory:** handoff + reflection.  
8. **Critic:** self-review workflow.  
9. **Lifecycle:** suggestions + human approval.  
10. **Polish:** examples, CI, docs.
